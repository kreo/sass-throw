## Sass Throw

```scss
// e.g.

```

**Sass Throw** is a set of functions to render `@error` `@warn` and `@debug` messages testable in Sass, by storing them in a list instead of triggering them (if the global flag `$catch-throws` is set). The messages can then be retrieved and verified by a testing utility such as [True]() or [Bootcamp]().

Inspired by suggestions from user @Undistraction posted in issue threads [at True](https://github.com/oddbird/true/issues/31) and [at Bootcamp](https://github.com/thejameskyle/bootcamp/issues/101).
